Collects user input through a clean HTML form.
Displays live preview or generates formatted resume in resume.html.
Supports multiple sections: personal info, education, skills, and experience.
Option to print or download resume as PDF (via browser or html2pdf.js).
Fully client-side — no data upload.

this is how my project works:

index.html — collects user data through forms.
app.js — handles event listeners, data validation, and passes data to resume.html (via localStorage or query params).
resume.html — formats and displays the resume using dynamic content injection.
css — contains layout, fonts, and print styling for PDF download.

Future Improvements may take place:

Add multiple templates for different resume styles.
Include dark/light mode toggle.
Support JSON export/import of user data.Using backend and implementing database.
